### Abstract

This paper advances the concept of epistemocracy as a normative model of higher education governance, grounded in fiduciary transparency, epistemic plurality, and distributed credibility. Building on fiduciary theory (Frankel, Smith, Miller), virtue epistemology (Fricker, Zagzebski, Medina), and critical pedagogy (Freire, Darder), I diagnose the epistemic crisis of contemporary universities through three new critical terms—optocratic drift, fiducial hollowing, and epistemic inversion. These neologisms identify how institutions privilege optics over substance, hollow fiduciary duties into public relations, and collapse plurality into singular figureheads. Against this backdrop, I propose epistemocracy as a structural reform: a governance framework embedding epistemic audit boards, fiduciary oversight mechanisms, decentralised credit infrastructures, and visual plurality protocols. The model resists epistemic injustice, strengthens fiduciary obligations, and restores universities’ democratic and epistemic integrity. Beyond academia, I argue epistemocracy provides a transferable governance framework for corporations, NGOs, and democratic institutions, modelling fiduciary–epistemic accountability in wider society.
