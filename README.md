### Abstract

This paper proposes _epistemocracy_, a transformative governance model for higher education institutions that explicitly prioritises epistemic plurality, fiduciary transparency, and distributed credibility. Critically responding to entrenched epistemic injustices, it introduces strategic conceptual tools—optocratic drift, fiducial hollowing, and epistemic inversion—to clearly identify and challenge institutional practices privileging visual representation and symbolic accountability over genuine epistemic diversity and fiduciary obligations. Drawing upon democratic epistemology (Anderson), critical pedagogy (Freire, Darder), fiduciary ethics (Frankel), and agonistic pluralism (Mouffe), epistemocracy seeks not mere institutional reform but profound epistemic reorientation. Ultimately, this work argues that epistemocracy not only restores universities’ democratic and epistemic integrity but significantly impacts broader societal issues including public trust, social justice, and democratic governance.

### Working Paper Status

This paper forms part of a wider research programme on fiduciary-epistemic governance and will be integrated into my forthcoming monograph _Beyond Epistemic Clientelism_. Readers are welcome to cite it, but please note that revisions are likely as the material is incorporated into the book project.
